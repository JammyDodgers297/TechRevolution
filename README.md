# README #

This readme outlines how to install this modpack through technic.

Disclaimer: I do not claim ownership of the mods in this modpack, I have merely compiled other people's work for download on technic. All support and donations should go to the mod developers, not me. 
Also, any errors concerning individual mods should go to the developers, as the help I am able to give is limited at best. Please DO send me crash reports, as they can be useful to me in the development of the modpack.

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository, as it stands, is simply a place for hosting and updating my modpack, The Tech Revolution. 

### How do I get set up? ###

To install this modpack, visit the Technic Platform site at https://www.technicpack.net and install the Technic Launcher.
With the application installed, open it and navigate to the 'Modpacks' tab. Within that tab is a search bar. 
In the search bar enter "JammyNetworks' Tech Revolution". There should only be one result, and if you are not sure, find the modpack which has 'JammyNetworks' as its developer.
Click 'install' and wait for it to download. That should be it. Click play and enjoy.

It is recommended to run the modpack with at least 4gb of allocated RAM and once it is opened, it is also recommended that you tweak the graphics options for optimum performance.

### Contribution guidelines ###

### Who do I talk to? ###

The owner and developer of this modpack is JammyNetworks (me). Any crash reports should be sent to me through the technic platform.
However, any issues regarding individual mods should go to the respective mod developer, as the help I can give is limited.

Mod requests and suggestions can also be done through the Technic Platform.
